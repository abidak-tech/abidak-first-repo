  <h1>Why I like programming</h1>
  <p>
    Programming is something I enjoy because it allows me to solve problemsand create useful things from nothing but ideas. When I write code, I feel like I am building something step by step. Programming helps me think logically, improves my problem-solving skills, and teaches me patience. I also like that there are many programming languages, each with its own purpose. Whether I am creating a website, a game, or a simple script, programming always feels rewarding and creative.

    Another reason I like programming is that it is constantly changing.
    There is always something new to learn, such as frameworks, tools, or
    better ways to write code. Programming also allows people to work together,
    share ideas, and improve projects as a team.
